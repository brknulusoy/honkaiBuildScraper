# honkaiBuildScraper
Python based program to scrape information about Honkai builds for the game 'Honkai Star Rail' from Prydwen.gg/star-rail/


# General information
- This project is fully made for fun since I found it hard to swap between characters in the website and find the information I was looking for.
- This program decreases the time of search by a significant margain helping with time consumption.

# How to use

- Run the main.exe to start the program

- Enter character name you want to get the following information for:
- > Light Cones
- > Relics
- > Best Stats and Substats

- There is an excel spredsheet called 'light_cones'. Edit it to the light cones you currently have.
- If you want to get another blank lightcone sheet for some reason click the get lightcone sheet button
- > Warning! This will delete all the information you have written in your current sheet.

- After making changes on your sheet you do not need to restart the program just press update

- To check other characters, close the window and type in the new character name
- When you are done, you can exit the window and type 'exit' to leave the program


# Information on builds
- All lightcones and relics are in order of best in slot to least best
- In relics the numbers show which order they are preffered
- If there are no numbers next to the relic, that shows the set is 2 piece with the previous set
